### A funny story (smaller header)

When I was a kid, while playing and running around with other kids, I ran into a window (hidden behind blind shutters) and broke it. 

When asked by the school director, I then pretended I slipped and crashed accidentally.

#### TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)

Don't run into windows, kiddos.


! IMPORTANT -> At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.
Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.

The links should have the following structure:

<< previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
