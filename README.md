At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like.

You can always count on me when... (smaller header)

Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make.

A funny story (smaller header)

Tell a short funny story about your life.

TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)

Summarise your funny story in one short sentence.

Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.

The links should have the following structure:

<< previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
